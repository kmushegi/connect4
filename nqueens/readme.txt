In the nqueens folder, our code is in aqueens.cpp and the executable isa queens.

To run, navigate to the nqueens folder, then in the command line type:

./aqueens NUM_STEPS NUM_QUEENS ALGO_TYPE

where:
—-> NUM_STEPS is the maximum number of steps allowed
—-> NUM_QUEENS is the problem size, or number of queens n, also size of board nxn
—-> ALGO_TYPE is one of the following five: BASIC, GREEDY, RANDOM, SMART-START*, FIRST-BETTER*

*Note: SMART-START and FIRST-BETTER are variations on the BASIC algorithm.

The output will print the initial board, the final board, whether or not a solution was found, and if so, the run time and number of steps it took to find the solution.
